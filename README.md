# SourceInfo

A database of information about news sources and content publishers to support content rating and analysis across various projects.

## Purpose

This project aims to build a comprehensive database of news sources and content publishers that can be used to:

- **Rate content quality** based on the source/domain that produced it
- **Understand content better** by incorporating source context and reputation
- **Provide metadata** about publishers for content analysis projects

The database will capture information about news sources, media outlets, blogs, and other content publishers that are frequently visited or may be encountered in the near term.

## Scope

This is an ongoing endeavor that will evolve over time. The initial focus is on:

- Gathering basic data on popular sites and frequently visited sources
- Building a foundation that can be expanded with more detailed information
- Creating a structured approach to collecting and organizing source metadata

## Data Collection Strategy

The project uses Playwright MCP with human-in-the-loop interaction to:

- Access subscription-based and authenticated sources
- Download information about multiple sites efficiently
- Gather data that may be behind paywalls or require login credentials

## Future Development

As the project matures, we will:

- Expand the database with more sources
- Add more detailed metadata and analysis
- Integrate with other content analysis and rating projects
- Develop tools to query and utilize the source information effectively

## Getting Started

This project is managed as a Claude project to facilitate ongoing development and data collection.
